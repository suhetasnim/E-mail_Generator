From past few days, my health condition is getting worse as I am suffering from various diseases. I have consulted my doctor and she advised me to take bed rest for atleast 3 days(more if needed).At this situation, it is not possible for me to continue my regular classes.I will attach my medical reports with this email. I will join as soon as possible after my recovery.I have a very good record of attendence and I promise to finish all my pending assignment as soon as I rejoin. I would like to pray and hope that you would be kind enough to approve my request.Thank you.Your obediently,
